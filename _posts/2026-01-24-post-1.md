The **Manipulation Group** at the **Hong Kong Centre for Logistics Robotics (HKCLR)** is recruiting highly motivated students and researchers to join our team.

Our group works at the intersection of **fundamental robotics research** and **real-world robotic products**, with a strong focus on developing **robust, autonomous, and deployable manipulation systems**. We design and build advanced robotic platforms ranging from **lightweight robotic arms** to **mobile dual-arm systems**, targeting manipulation tasks in **unstructured and contact-rich environments**.

Our research philosophy emphasizes the tight integration of **model-based methods** and **learning-driven techniques**. This includes physics-based modeling and control, data-driven and learning-based manipulation, as well as emerging **vision–language–action (VLA)** and multimodal perception frameworks. By combining mechanical design, sensing, control, and AI, we aim to bridge the gap between laboratory research and practical robotic deployment.

### Open Positions

We welcome applications from:
- **Robotics engineers**
- **Research assistants**
- **Research interns**

Candidates with interests or experience in the following areas are especially encouraged to apply:
- Robotic manipulation and control  
- Mobile manipulation and dual-arm systems  
- Vision-based and multimodal perception  
- Learning-based control, imitation learning, and reinforcement learning  
- System integration and real-world experimentation  

### What We Offer

- Access to **state-of-the-art robotic platforms and facilities**
- Opportunities to work on **cutting-edge research projects** with real-world impact
- A collaborative research environment combining **theory, algorithms, and hardware**
- Strong support for **academic publications** and **technology transfer**

If you are interested in joining us or would like to learn more, please feel free to reach out or follow our future updates on this blog.
