  description: >
    An embodied AI framework that integrates vision–language models (VLMs)
    for high-level task understanding and long-horizon planning, together
    with vision–language–action (VLA) policies for dynamic interaction.
    The framework bridges semantic reasoning and low-level robot control
    for dual-arm manipulation tasks.
