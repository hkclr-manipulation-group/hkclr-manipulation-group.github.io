  description: >
    An embodied AI framework that integrates vision-language models (VLMs)
    for high-level task understanding and decomposition, with
    vision-language-action (VLA) policies for dynamic interaction.
    The framework bridges semantic reasoning and low-level robot control
    for long-horizon manipulation tasks.
