### Abstract

This paper studies the configurability selection of robotic arms for uterus manipulation in laparoscopic hysterectomy under constrained task and environment conditions. A unified modeling framework is proposed to evaluate feasible configurations by considering task requirements, environmental constraints, and robot kinematics. Heuristic-based methods are employed to identify suitable robotic arm configurations that improve operational feasibility and safety in real-time surgical scenarios.
