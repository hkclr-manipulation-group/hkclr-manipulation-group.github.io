Welcome to the blog of the **Manipulation Group at the Hong Kong Centre for Logistics Robotics (HKCLR)**.

Our research focuses on **robotic manipulation systems** that bridge **fundamental research** and **real-world deployment**. We develop platforms ranging from **lightweight robotic arms** to **mobile dual-arm systems**, with an emphasis on **autonomy, robustness, and deployability** in unstructured, contact-rich environments.

Here we share research updates, technical notes, system design experiences, and perspectives on **model-based and learning-driven manipulation**, including vision–language–action approaches.
