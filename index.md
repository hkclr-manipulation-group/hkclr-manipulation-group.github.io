Based at the
[Hong Kong Centre for Logistics Robotics (HKCLR)](https://www.hkclr.hk/),
the Manipulation Group conducts research on advanced robotic manipulation systems.
Our work spans lightweight robotic arms and mobile dual-arm platforms, with a strong
emphasis on intelligent control and autonomy. We explore both model-based and
learning-based approaches, including vision-language-action models and data-driven
control frameworks.

Our research investigates how robots can achieve reliable manipulation in
unstructured, constrained, and contact-rich environments. By integrating control
theory, machine learning, and perception, we aim to endow robotic systems with
robust decision-making and adaptive interaction capabilities.

We design and build complete robotic systems, covering areas such as medical
robotics, soft and continuum manipulators, and data-driven control.
Our projects tightly couple hardware development with principled modeling
and learning-based algorithms to address real-world deployment challenges.
