We are the HKCLR Manipulation Group, focusing on intelligent robotic manipulation,
visual servoing, and medical and continuum robotics. Our research aims to enable
robots to operate robustly in complex, constrained, and unstructured environments
through principled control, learning, and perception.

We develop robotic systems and algorithms spanning medical robotics, soft and
continuum robots, and data-driven control. Our projects integrate hardware design,
model-based methods, and learning-based approaches to address real-world challenges.
